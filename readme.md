**What is Neverinstall?**
Neverinstall is a next-gen cloud computing platform that streams applications using the WebRTC protocol. It allows browser-based access to desktop-class applications, helps makes apps device agnostic, and improves their performance. 
The platform offers pre-installed and pre-configured applications which can be accessed with a single click.
***Why should you use Neverinstall?***
Neverinstall helps you access resource-hungry apps through the browser and offloads the system requirements to the cloud. This enables seamless performance and universal access and unlocks browsing speeds of up to 2 Gbps through cloud browsers on the platform. 
***How can you use Neverinstall?***
The platform allows users to create ‘Spaces.’ Each Space is an independent cloud PC containing all the apps a user selects, pre-installed and pre-configured. A Space offers native-like access to the Linux OS, allowing users to do virtually everything they can on their local machine. 
***What sets Neverinstall apart?***
Neverinstall is designed to simplify setup and access to applications.
Since the platform offers pre-configured applications, setup time for applications and the cloud PCs is reduced to seconds. All apps on the platform are available as one-click apps.
The platform can be used through any device that supports a browser. Therefore, users can access full-featured desktop-class software from mobile tablets as well.
The platform provides Sudo access to allow users to test applications in a secure and isolated environment. 
The platform offers 11 servers in different regions throughout the world. Users can launch an app in any of those regions. This allows users to reduce latency to improve performance and even lets them use the platform as a VPN.
